##Overview

* Prep 30 mins, 2 hours in the oven, 20 minutes on the grill
* Makes 5-6 servings

##Ingredients

* 2 medium onions, chopped
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 cup packed brown sugar
* 1 cup water
* 1 cup spicy ketchup
* 3 tablespoons white vinegar
* 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tablespoon Liquid Smoke, optional
* 2 teaspoons ground mustard
* 2 teaspoons chili powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon onion salt
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper
* 5 to 6 pounds pork baby back ribs

##Instructions

1. In a large saucepan, saute onions in butter until tender. Add garlic, cook 1 minute longer. Stir in the brown sugar, water, ketchup, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, Liquid Smoke if desired, mustard, chili powder, paprika and cayenne. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer for 10-12 minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat.
2. In a small bowl, combine the salt, onion salt, garlic salt and pepper; sprinkle over ribs.
3. Grill ribs, covered, over indirect medium heat for 1-3/4 hours or until tender.
4. Set aside 1 cup barbecue sauce for serving. Brush some of the remaining sauce over ribs; cook 20 minutes longer, turning ribs occasionally and basting with sauce. Serve with reserved sauce. Yield: 5-6 servings. 

##Notes

* [original recipe](http://www.tasteofhome.com/Recipes/Ribs-with-a-Kick)
* Instead of grilling in step 3, I cooked the ribs in the oven for ~2 hours at 300 F.  Basically I waited until they were falling apart.
* We didn't have spicy ketchup, so we added hot pepper sauce (tabasco) to taste.
* These were really good.
