##Ingredients
* 1 1/2 lb. steak, flank
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/2 c. carrots, shredded
* 4 onion, green, sliced, one is for garnish
* 1 tsp. onion, dried minced (or 1/2 fresh onion, diced very small)
* 1/2 c. soy sauce, gluten free
* 1/4 c. wine, white
* 1/4 c. cooking sherry
* 1/2 T. vinegar, white wine(optional)
* 1 tsp. sesame oil
* 1 tsp. molasses
* 1 tsp. ginger
* 1/4 tsp. black pepper
* 1 tsp. red chili pepper flakes
* 1/2 T. peanut butter (if allergic, use black bean paste)
* 3 T. brown sugar
* 1/4 c. cornstarch (to dredge meat--don't add to sauce mixture)

##Instructions

1. Slice steak into thin strips and toss in a Ziploc bag with cornstarch to coat.

2. Add all of the liquid and dried spices to your crock pot, and the peanut butter (or alternative if necessary), and mix well.

3. Add the garlic and three of the sliced green onions. If you are using fresh onion, add that at this time, too.

4. Place the steak on top, and toss gingerly to coat.

5. Cover. Cook on low for 4-6 hours.

NOTE: Flank steak is thin and has very little fat, and will cook quickly. There isnât a lot of liquid in this dish, so if your crock tends to cook hot, please check it after 3 hours! The meat is done when it is no longer pink and has reaches desired tenderness.

Serve over steamed or fried rice, and garnish with freshly sliced green onion.
