##Notes

* [original recipe](http://www.forkknifeswoon.com/food-drink/appetizers-nibbles/2013/05/goat-cheese-stuffed-cherry-peppers/)
* The peppers weren't actually spicy.  Also I marinated and cooked the stuffed peppers according to [martha stewart's recipe](http://www.marthastewart.com/317762/stuffed-marinated-hot-red-cherry-peppers).  I don't think I would do that again, however.
* The goat cheese/ricotta mix was really good.  We made it separately and spread directly on bread.
