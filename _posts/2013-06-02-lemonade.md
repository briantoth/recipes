##Overview

* Less than 10 minutes to make
* Makes about 3 servings (glasses)

##Ingredients

* 3/4 cup sugar
* 3/4 cup water (for the simple syrup)
* 1 cup lemon juice
* 2-3 cups cold water (to dilute)

##Instructions

1. Make simple syrup by heating the sugar and water in a small saucepan until the sugar is dissolved completely.
2. While the sugar is dissolving, use a juicer to extract the juice from 4 to 6 lemons, enough for one cup of juice.
3. Add the juice and the sugar water to a pitcher. Add 2 to 3 cups of cold water, more or less to the desired strength. Refrigerate 30 to 40 minutes. If the lemonade is a little sweet for your taste, add a little more straight lemon juice to it.

* The original recipe was very sweet and rather diluted, so I changed the proportions
