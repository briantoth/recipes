##Overview

* Cooking time
    * Prep 20 mins
    * ~13 minutes in the oven
* Makes ~5 servings

##Ingredients

* 6 ounces semi-sweet chocolate (I used Ghirardelli chips)
* 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate (I used Perugina) 
* 3/4 cup unsalted butter, plus an extra pat for buttering ramekins
* 3 egg yolks
* 3 whole eggs
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
* extra flour, or cocoa powder, for dusting ramekins

##Instructions

1. Butter the bottom and sides of 4 six-ounce ramekins.  Dust with flour or cocoa powder (flour might leave a slight white residue, cocoa will blend in with the cake), and tap to remove excess.  
2. Melt all the chocolate and the butter in a double boiler, then set aside to cool.  Meanwhile, combine eggs and sugar in a mixing bowl and cream together on medium-high speed.  The batter will become thickened and form ribbons when beating, and it will double in volume from incorporating air into the eggs (see photo above for a visual of the batter).  Add the flour to the egg batter, and blend for an additional 2-3 minutes.  Then add the chocolate and blend for an additional 2 minutes, scraping bowl once or twice to incorporate everything.  This is important because the chocolate is much more dense than the batter so it will sink to the bottom of the mixing bowl. 
3. Fill each ramekin with about 6 ounces of batter, and refrigerate for 1 hour or longer.  (If you prefer, these can be prepared 24 hours in advance and refrigerated until serving.)  To bake, preheat oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit, and bake ramekins on a baking sheet for about 11-13 minutes.  When they are done, they should be puffed up and the center of the top should look solid.  Importantly, they should pass the "jiggle test."  With an oven mitt, grab the edge of the baking sheet and shake it a little bit.  If the top jiggles a lot, they are not done.  Close the oven and check them again until the top jiggles ever so slightly, or not at all.    Remove ramekins from the oven and serve immediately.

Cakes can be served in the ramekins, or wait a few minutes and invert individual cakes onto a plate.  Serve with whipped cream, fresh berries, candied nuts, or whatever strikes your fancy.   

##Notes

* [original recipe](http://cilantropist.blogspot.com/2010/05/molten-chocolate-lava-cake.html)
* Make a test cake first so you figure out the exact timing for your oven
* Recipe barely makes enough for 5 cakes in 6 oz ramekins
