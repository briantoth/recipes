##Overview

* Cooking time
    * Prep 15 mins
    * 30 minutes in the oven
* Makes 4 servings

##Ingredients

* 1 pound  Italian sausage -- crumbled
* 2 jars  pasta sauce
* 1 can  black olives -- sliced, drained (2-1/4 ounces), optional
* 1 box  Mostaccioli -- 16 ounces (can be another pasta)
* 1/4 cup  Parmigiano Reggiano cheese -- freshly grated, optional
* 2 cups  mozzarella cheese -- shredded
* 1 tablespoon  chopped parsley -- optional
* 1 medium  onion

##Instructions

* Preheat oven to 350 F
* Heat sausage and onion in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook 7 to 10 minutes or until meat is cooked through, stirring occasionally.
* Stir in pasta sauce and olives.  Reduce heat to medium low; simmer 5 minutes.
* Cook pasta according to package directions, but undercook about 5 minutes; drain and return to pot.
* Add sauce mixture and mozzerella cheese to hot pasta; toss.  Pour into greased 13x9-inch baking dish; cover.
* Bake 20 minutes; uncover.  Sprinkle parmigian cheese over pasta; continue baking uncovered 5 to 7 minutes, or until cheese is melted.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

##Notes

* I prefer to use a deeper dish so that the mostaccioli is less baked and more gooey
* relatively quick and easy to make
