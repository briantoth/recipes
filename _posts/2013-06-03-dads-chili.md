##Overview

* Cooking time
    * Prep 30 mins
    * 1 hour on the stove (or longer in a slow cooker)
    * 20 minutes on the grill
* Makes 4 servings

##Ingredients

* 3 pounds  boneless chuck -- cut into bite-sized pieces
* 2 cloves  garlic -- minced or chopped
* 4 tablespoons  chile powder -- up to 6 tablespoons
* 2 teaspoons  ground cumin
* 4 tablespoons  flour
* 1 tablespoon  oregano
* 1 teaspoon  salt
* 1/4 teaspoon  pepper
* 1 can  pinto beans -- drained (15 oz.)
* 1 can  kidney beans -- drained (15 oz.)
* 4 cubes  beef bouillon -- dissolved in 4 cups hot waters

##Instructions

1. Over high heat, in stewing pot, brown the meat with garlic until it changes color.
* Add the flour and spices.  Add 2 cups prepared bouillon.
* Cover pot and simmer 30 minutes.
* Add remaining bouillon and simmer approximately 30 more minutes or until meat is tender.
* Add beans and heat.
* Serve with grated cheese, chopped scallions, and sour cream.

##Notes

* Sometimes I will cook this in a slow cooker for 3-4 hours (instead of step 4).  This makes the meat more tender.
