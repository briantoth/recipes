##Overview

* Cooking time
    * Prep 30 mins
    * 12 minutes on the grill
* Makes 4 servings

##Ingredients

* 2 cups  spinach -- chopped, packed into cups
* 1 pound  lean ground lamb
* 1/2 cup  pine nuts -- finely groud
* 1 small onion -- minced
* 2 cloves  garlic -- minced
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 teaspoon  ground coriander
* 1/2 teaspoon  salt
* 8 pita breads
* Olive oil
* feta cheese
* several sprigs  fresh mint

##Instructions

1. Bring a medium-size pot of water to boil over high heat.  Stir in the spinach and cook just until the water begins to boil again, 1 minute.  Drain in a colander and set aside to cool and drip dry.
* Place the lamb, pine nuts, onion, garlic, egg, coriander, and salt in a medium-size bowl.  Add the cooled spinach and mix well.  Divide the mixture into 8 portions and shape each one into a "sausage" 4 to 5 inches long and 1-1/2 inches in diameter.  Cover and set aside in the refirgerator until ready to cook (they will keep as long as overnight).
* Heat a grill to medium-high.  May be cooked under a broiler instead.
* Place the souvlaki "sausages" on the grill rack and cook, turning once, until barely pink in the center, but still moist, 10 to 12 minutes.  Transfer them to a serving platter and set aside.
* Lightly coat the pitas with oil.  Place them on the grill rack and grill, turning once, until very lightly toasted, 1 to 1-1/2 minutes.
* Serve the souvlaki accompanied by the pitas, feta,and mint sprigs.
