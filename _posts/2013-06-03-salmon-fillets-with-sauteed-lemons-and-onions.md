##Overview

* Cooking time
    * Prep 10 mins
    * 23 minutes to cook
* Makes 4 servings

##Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons sour cream or creme fraiche
* 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets, skinned
* Essence, recipe follows
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus 2 tablespoons
* 1 medium yellow onion, very thinly sliced
* 2 medium lemons, ends trimmed and sliced into very thin rounds
* 12 ounces farfalle pasta
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/4 cup sliced scallions
* Chopped fresh parsley leaves, garnish

##Instructions


1.  In a small bowl, stir to combine the sour cream, lemon juice, and salt. Set aside.
2.  Meanwhile, lightly season the salmon on both sides with Essence.
3.  In a large skillet or saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the onions and cook just until beginning to get translucent, about 3 minutes. Spread the onions out so they cover the bottom of the pan. Place the salmon fillets on top of the onions and lower the heat to medium-low. Top the salmon with the lemon slices. Cover and cook until the salmon is just cooked through and the onions are caramelized, about 8 to 10 minutes. Be careful not to burn the onions while the salmon is cooking. If they begin to burn, add a little water to moisten them.
4.  While the salmon is cooking, cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water. Drain and toss with remaining olive oil, salt, and scallions.
5.  Divide the warm pasta among 4 large plates. Place 1 salmon fillet and the sauteed lemons and onions over each serving of pasta. Top with the sour cream sauce and drizzle with the extra-virgin olive oil. Garnish with parsley and serve.
