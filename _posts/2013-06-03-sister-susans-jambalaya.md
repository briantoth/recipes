##Overview

* Cooking time
    * Prep 15 mins (longer if shelling the shrimp)
    * 30 minutes to cook
* Makes 4 servings

##Ingredients

* 1 pound  andouille sausage
* 1/2 medium white onion -- chopped fine
* 1 small green bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
* 1 clove  garlic -- minced (can be 2 cloves)
* 1 bay leaf
* 1/2 teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
* 1/8 teaspoon  ground cumin
* 1/8 teaspoon  ground cloves
* 1/8 teaspoon  ground allspice
* 1/4 teaspoon  groud red (cayenne) pepper
* freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
* 2 cans  beef broth -- (16 ounce each)
* 2 cups  uncooked rice
* salt -- to taste (about 1 tablespoon)
* 1 pound  raw shrimp -- peeled

##Instructions

1. Melt butter in a thick-bottomed pot or Dutch oven.
* Add sausage and ham; cook until lightly browned.
* Add onions, scallions, green pepper, and garlic; cook until vegetables are soft and onion is transparent. 
* Stir in bay leaf, thyme, cumin, cloves, allspice, red pepper, and black pepper.
* Add beef broth; mix well.
* Stir in the rice.
* Season with salt.  The liquid in the pot should just cover the contents.  Add more broth if necessary. (The rice will absorb most of the moisture. A jambalaya should be damp, but not soupy.)
* Bring the mixture to a boil, then turn heat to very low.
* Cover pot; cook until rice is done.  Add shrimp and chicken during the last 10-15 minutes.  Chicken should be pre-cooked.  A good time to add the shrimp is when the rice has absorbed almost all of the liquid; turn off the heat and add shrimp.

###Alternative Directions from mom

1. Brown sausage in pan then take out, using the grease leftover from the sausage, cook the onions, green pepper and garlic until soft (I usually add the garlic at the end, it doesn't need to cook long and makes it taste better if not cooked for too long). Add spices and rice, stir. Then add beef broth. Cover and simmer until rice is almost done (and liquid is mostly gone) then add peeled shrimp.  
2. At this point I usually turn off the burner and just let the shrimp cook in the heat from the pan/ingredients.  Shrimp does not take long to cook and better to err on the shorter side then to overcook. You can always turn the stove back on if it doesn't cook, but I have never had to.

##Notes

* if you have leftovers.  Heat up the mixture without the shrimp. Then add them back in for the last few seconds (depending on how much you are re-heating), you don't want them tasting like rubber!
